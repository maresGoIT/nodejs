### Lesson 2: Advanced JWT Strategies and Application (2 Hours)

#### Objective:

Dive deeper into JWT strategies, including token storage and handling, and implementing a registration route and secure route access.

#### Materials:

- Presentation slides on advanced JWT concepts.
- Continuation of the Express app from Lesson 1.

#### Part 1: Advanced JWT Strategies (30 Minutes)

- **JWT Strategy for Authentication** (15 minutes)

  - Discuss strategies for storing JWTs in a client application (LocalStorage vs Cookies).
  - Handling JWT expiration and renewal.

- **Security Considerations** (15 minutes)
  - Discuss common security pitfalls (e.g., not using HTTPS, exposure to XSS attacks).
  - Best practices for secure JWT usage.

#### Part 2: Implementing a Registration Route (30 Minutes)

- **User Registration and Token Issuance** (30 minutes)
  - Live coding: Implement a registration route that creates a user and issues a JWT upon successful registration.
  - Discuss the importance of hashing passwords before storage.

#### Break (10 Minutes)

#### Part 3: Full Authentication Flow in an Express App (50 Minutes)

- **Obtaining a Token for Authorization** (25 minutes)

  - Reiterate the process of obtaining a JWT through the login route.
  - Discuss different methods of sending the JWT for accessing protected routes (headers, cookies).

- **Implementing a "Route Closed" Strategy** (25 minutes)
  - Live coding: Enhance the middleware to reject requests without a valid JWT or with expired tokens.
  - Testing and debugging: Demonstrate the complete flow from registration, login, accessing protected routes, and handling errors.

### Conclusion and Q&A (10 Minutes)

Wrap up the session with a summary of key points covered. Open the floor for questions and provide additional resources for further learning (documentation, tutorials, articles).

This lesson plan is designed to offer a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application, ensuring that participants not only grasp the concepts of JWT but also know how to implement them in real-world Express applications.
